Safety Considerations\nIf a tow is undertaken, the Auxiliary vessel is required to notify the Operational Commander of the identity of the vessel, location of the vessel, and the destination to which the vessel is being towed. No Auxiliary vessel may undertake the tow of another vessel unless the coxswain is reasonably assured of the safety of both vessels and the persons aboard. If the Auxiliary vessel cannot safely tow a disabled vessel that is standing into danger, it may endeavor to remove the persons from the threatened vessel and stand by until a more capable resource arrives on scene.\n\nIn cases involving towing by the Coast Guard Auxiliary, the vessel being assisted will normally be taken to the nearest safe haven. Coast Guard Auxiliary resources should not tow the vessel beyond the nearest safe haven when there are commercial resources that could perform this function. Exceptions to this policy may be made in specific cases if, in the judgment of the SAR mission coordinator (SMC), they are warranted by humanitarian or other concerns.\n\nE.9.c.

Per Rule 25(d) they must be lit with 1 of 3 options between sunset and sunrise:\n\ndisplay the lights of a sailing vessel per Rule 25 and Annex I; or display an all-round white light (visible for at least 2 miles [per Rule 22] and meet the technical characteristics [i.e. color, intensity] per Annex I); or\nhave at hand either an electric torch (flashlight) or lighted lantern (oil or gas) which need not comply with Rule 22 or Annex I.\nPreferably, option #3 provides similar lighting, intensity and characteristics of an all-around white light (versus a single beam of light);\nmay be mounted, worn, stowed, etc so long as it is ready at hand to warn other mariners; and,\nshould be used in ample time so as to warn others of danger and in manner consistent with Rule 36, so that it not embarrass any vessel (i.e. so as not to blind or otherwise negatively impact their navigation).", "ground_truth_sources": []}}
