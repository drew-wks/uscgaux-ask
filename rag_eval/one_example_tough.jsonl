This also encompasses unwelcome display or communication of sexually offensive materials. Auxiliary leaders are responsible for preventing harassment and discrimination. Unlawful harassment is discrimination that violates federal law. Unlawful harassment includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, nonverbal, or physical, that is based on an individual’s protected status (including: race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, status as a parent, marital status, political affiliation, and retaliation) and is so objectively offensive as to alter the victim’s conditions of employment.", "ground_truth_sources": ["Auxiliary Manual, COMDTINST M16790.1G", "U.S. COAST GUARD CIVIL RIGHTS MANUAL, COMDTINST M5350.4E"]}}
