###### 
 **Why did you create ASK?**  
 Being a member of the U.S. Coast Guard like you, I was surrounded by vast amounts of policy and procedure information that guides my actions.  However, that bulk of that information is stowed away in PDFs scattered across various platforms, making it cumbersome to locate and search. Furthermore, outdated and regionally-specific documents can be misconstrued as applicable. So, I created ASK to show how Artificial Intelligence can help Auxiliarists and prospective members find the information we need to do our work.


 **How does ASK stay up to date?**  
Each year, The Coast Guard cancels policies and replaces policies with new ones. ASK keeps all documents in a central repository that is managed by an Auxiliarst. This person is responsible for tracking new policy and updating the library to ensure it has the most recent national policy available. If you see a document missing from the libary or one that should be removed, please send an email to uscgaux.drew@wks.us.

**How does ASK work?**  
ASK works by taking a user’s question from a search bar, retrieving related information from a pre-defined library of USCG reference documents, and then generating a detailed response back to the user that includes the source citations. ASK relies on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Gen AI brings together the powerful information retrieval of a search engine with text generation ability of a Generative AI operating within a controlled organizational environment [see detail image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drew-wks/ASK/main/images/rag_flow.png)

**Is ASK a chatbot like ChatGPT?**  
No. Though ASK uses Generative AI, it is not a chatbot like ChatGPT. Commercial chatbots such as ChatGPT area versatile, but as a result, they are not naturally suited to all applications. Chatbots suffer from several significant drawbacks that limit their application in organizations. For instance, they aren’t trained on Auxiliary information. They do not understand that common words such as “task”, “division”, or even “auxiliary” have specific meanings in the Auxiliary. They don’t understand authority and answer questions at all costs, whether they “know” the answer or not. In contrast, ASK is designed to do one thing: retrieve and summarize information.  As a result, it does not suffer from these drawbacks because it is based on the Auxiliary’s own internal information. That allows it to respond with a high level of accuracy and quality. If it doesn't know an answer, it will just say it doesn't know.

**What is ASK used for?**  
ASK has many uses. Members can look up programs and competency requirements. For new members, it’s a safe and educational space for questions they may be hesitant to ask in person. Trainees can learn concepts, compare and contrast terms-- even take a quiz with ASK. With an easy-to-use interface, ASK is field-ready. Finally, ASK’s foreign language translation abilities supports language access.  
 
Specific use cases for ASK include:   
- Policy Compliance: ASK can assist members fulfill their responsibilities to understand and adhere to policy, and help the organization transition to new policies. For example, a member can find the policy changes affecting their competency.  
- New Member Onboarding: ASK can help new members integrate into the Auxiliary. For example, a new member can ask questions that might make them “feel stupid” to ask in person. A supportive and informative “first ninety days” sets the foundation for a productive and engaged member.  
- Training Support: ASK provides personalized learning for trainees. It can compare and contrast terms or create custom quizzes, with ASK grading the results  
- In-the-Field Mission Support: ASK facilitates instant, on-the-go access to crucial documents during mission execution, enhancing Auxiliarist performance efficiency and decision-making. It can create checklists and provide Quick information retrieval. For example, an AUX Culinary Assistant could immediately determine all the currency requirements for the competency.  
- Language Access: ASK can assist the US Coast Guard in fulfilling its requirements under Executive Order 13166, “Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency” by detecting language automatically and translate both question and responses in real time   

**What technologies are behind ASK?**

**What AI model is this using to answer questions?**  
There are two parts to the system. The first part is to look up relevant information from USCG documents. No AI service is used to do this. The second part is to formulate a response based on those document exerpts. ASK currently uses OpenAI API for this, which is a paid service.  We regularly tests other services as well to find the best value.

**Is ASK teaching or training company's AI using our questions?**  
Not at all.  The inputs and outputs are owned by Drew Wilkins. No AI model is being trained on this data.
