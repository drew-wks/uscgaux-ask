#### ASK Overview
ASK stands for Auxiliary Source of Knowledge. ASK was developed by Auxiliarist Drew Wilkins to make it easier for Auxiliarists and prospective members to find Auxiliary-related information. Powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), ASK searches over 200     Coast Guard Auxiliary references to find answers directly from authoritative sources.

#### Background
ASK stems from the need for easier ways to find official information. Auxiliarists are surrounded by vast amounts of policy and procedure information that guides their actions.

However, that bulk of that information is stowed away in PDFs scattered across various platforms, making it cumbersome to located and search. Furthermore, outdated and regionally-specific documents can be misconstrued as applicable. Web searches yield thousands of documents, but it is difficult to know which one applies. Tools like Chat GPT might provide inaccurate data or even fabricate responses.

ASK is different. It examines the documents themselves, and then uses AI to answer them in natural language. ASK works by analyzing documents that are the most current official policy that exists at a national level. Its library contains over 250 policy documents— from Commandant Instructions to ALAUXs to national workshops—managed in a central location. Scope is limited to publicly-available, national documents, so it doesn’t include information behind firewall or specific to individual districts, sectors, divisions, etc. That way, even applicants can use it without authentication.

#### Uses
You can use ASK to look up programs and competency requirements. For new members, it’s a safe and educational space for questions they may be hesitant to ask in person. Trainees can learn concepts, compare and contrast terms-- even take a quiz with ASK. With an easy-to-use interface, ASK is field-ready. Finally, ASK’s foreign language translation abilities supports language access.
