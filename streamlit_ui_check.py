def check_app_status(url):
    """
    This function checks the status of a web application by navigating to the provided URL 
    and searching for specific text strings ("USCG Auxiliary" and "Zzzz") on the page.
    
    The function uses Selenium to automate a Chrome browser in headless mode, which means 
    it operates without a visible GUI. This is particularly useful in environments like 
    GitHub Actions, where a graphical user interface is not available.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL of the web page to check.

    Behavior:
        - If the text "USCG Auxiliary" is found on the page, the function prints "USCG Auxiliary".
        - If the text "Zzzz" is found on the page, the function prints "Zzzz".
        - If neither text is found, the function prints the entire text content of the page.
        - The function includes error handling to catch and report issues such as network errors or problems with the web driver setup.

    Note:
        This script is designed to run in headless mode, making it suitable for use in 
        environments without a GUI, such as in automated CI/CD pipelines on GitHub Actions.

    Example:
        >>> check_app_status("https://ask-test.streamlit.app/")
        USCG Auxiliary
